INTRODUCTION

The data set contains electrical and mechanical signals from experiments on three-phase induction motors. The experimental tests were carried out for different mechanical loads on the induction motor axis and different severities of broken bar defects in the motor rotor, including data regarding the rotor without defects. Ten repetitions were performed for each experimental condition.

Instructions: Experimental Setup:

The experimental workbench consists of a three-phase induction motor coupled with a direct-current machine, which works as a generator simulating the load torque, connected by a shaft containing a rotary torque wrench.

Induction motor: 1hp, 220V/380V, 3.02A/1.75A, 4 poles, 60 Hz, with a nominal torque of 4.1 Nm and a rated speed of 1715 rpm. The rotor is of the squirrel cage type composed of 34 bars.

Load torque: is adjusted by varying the field winding voltage of direct current generator. A single-phase voltage variator with a filtered full-bridge rectifier is used for the purpose. An induction motor was tested under 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, 75, 87.5 and 100% of full load.

Broken rotor bar: to simulate the failure on the three-phase induction motor's rotor, it was necessary to drill the rotor. The rupture rotor bars are generally adjacent to the first rotor bar, 4 rotors have been tested, the first with a break bar, the second with two adjacent broken bars, and so on rotor containing four bars adjacent broken.

Monitoring condition:

All signals were sampled at the same time for 18 seconds for each loading condition and ten repetitions were performed from transient to steady state of the induction motor.

mechanical signals: five axial accelerometers were used simultaneously, with a sensitivity of 10 mV/mm/s, frequency range from 5 to 2000Hz and stainless steel housing, allowing vibration measurements in both drive end (DE) and non-drive end (NDE) sides of the motor, axially or radially, in the horizontal or vertical directions.

electrical signals: the currents were measured by alternating current probes, which correspond to precision meters, with a capacity of up to 50ARMS, with an output voltage of 10 mV/A, corresponding to the Yokogawa 96033 model. The voltages were measured directly at the induction terminals using voltage points of the oscilloscope and the manufacturer Yokogawa.
