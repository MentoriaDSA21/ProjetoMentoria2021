The bench of experiments is on the premises of the School of Engineering of São Carlos (EESC) of the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil, more specifically in the Laboratory of Intelligent Automation of Processes and Systems (LAIPS) and Laboratory of Intelligent Control of Electrical Machines (LACIME).
The three-phase induction motor is a model of the W22 standard line from manufacturer WEG, 1 cv, 220V / 380V, 3.02A / 1.75A, 4 poles, 60 Hz, with a nominal torque of 4.1 N.m and nominal speed of 1715 rpm. The rotor is a squirrel cage type made up of 34 bars. It is driven by means of a control panel that allows the selection of the type of drive, star or triangle, and the type of supply, direct mains voltage or via a three-phase inverter.
The rotary torque wrench used in the research is the Transtec model MT-103, with a maximum rotation of 2000 rpm, based on Wheatstone bridge technology and with a sensitivity of 2 mV / V. Its main function is to allow visualization of the torque present in the shaft, which will be varied simulating various operating conditions of the induction motor.
Manual adjustment of the resistant torque is done by varying the field winding voltage of the direct current generator. Therefore, to reduce the magnitude of the grid voltage, a 1800W single-phase voltage variation is used by Variac, and to convert the alternating voltage to continuous, a single-phase rectifier is used which feeds the field winding.
The vibration sensors used were Vibrocontrol uniaxial accelerometers, model PU 2001, with sensitivity of 10 mV / mm / s, frequency range 5 to 2000 Hz and stainless-steel housing, which provides the integrated acceleration signal over time. , ie provides the measure of vibration velocity. In total five accelerometers were used simultaneously, located non-drive end side motor, drive end side motor, housing, in the axial direction of the motor, and on the support desk. Therefore, these monitoring points allow the measurement of axial, tangential and radial velocity.
The currents were measured using alternating current probes, which correspond to precision meters, with a capacity of up to 50 A RMS, with an output voltage of 10 mV / A, corresponding to the Yokogawa model 96033. The voltages were measured directly at the MIT terminals using oscilloscope voltage tips also from the manufacturer Yokogawa.
To simulate the failure of broken bars in the squirrel cage rotor of the three-phase induction motor it was necessary to drill the rotor. Drilling was carried out by means of a bench drill mounted with a 6 mm diameter drill to ensure that the diameter of the hole exceeds the width of a rotor bar, with the tip centered at half the longitudinal length of the rotor.
Thus, a rotor without a hole was tested first, that is, a healthy rotor, and then it was successively replaced in order to obtain a database of monitored variables.
Experiments were carried out using the bench mentioned above for the construction of the database. Tests were carried out on healthy motors and motors with defects in direct start with balanced three-phase supply voltage and 60 Hz frequency.
For the preparation of a reliable database, enabling future work were applied 0.5nm shipments, 1,0Nm, 1,5Nm, 2,0Nm, 2,5Nm, 3,0Nm, 3,5Nm, and 4.0Nm to the axis of the three-phase induction motor. For each loading condition of the motor shaft, ten repetitions were performed.
In this way, using the data acquisition system, for each experiment of each loading, the following variables were acquired:
•	voltages in phases A, B, and C;
•	currents in phases A, B, and C;
•	mechanical vibration speeds tangential in the housing, tangential in the base, axial on the driven side, radial on the driven side, and radial on the non-drive side.
This experimental process was performed for the detection and diagnosis of failures for healthy engines and engines with rotors containing 1, 2, 3, and 4 bars broken adjacent.
The database is organized as a structure of the Matlab application. The “struct_rs_R1” structure presents the experimental data referring to the defectless induction motor, “struct_r1b_R1” referring to the rotor with one broken bar, “struct_r2b_R1” referring to the rotor with two broken bars, “struct_r3b_R1” referring to the rotor with three broken bars and “Struct_r4b_R1” for the rotor with four broken bars.
When loading the files containing the experimental data for each structure in the Matlab application, it will be possible to view the experimental data for each of the mechanical loads imposed on the motor shaft. Then, it will be possible to observe the experimental data for each monitored variable.
